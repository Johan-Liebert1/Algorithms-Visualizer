1. Store all elements swaps in an array and return that at the end. Then repeat the process in the component to make state changes and have the viz going

2. Pass a callback function to the sorting function which would be called everytime a swap action occurs. Return a promise from the callback function using setTimeout. This way we can also take care of speeding up or slowing down the viz.
